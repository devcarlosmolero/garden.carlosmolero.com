# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Carlos


I'm delighted that you've stopped by my digital garden.

Remember that <b>I am open to working as a software engineer or UX/UI designer on a freelance basis</b>. Click <a class="internal-link" href="/hire-me">here</a> to learn about my professional background and how to hire me.

I prefer to write short and concise ideas that I can revisit later to expand upon. For this reason, I felt that the traditional blog format didn't suit me.

I believe that blogs, especially now with AI, have become tools focused on monetization and marketing, straying from their original purpose: **sharing human knowledge and experiences**.
