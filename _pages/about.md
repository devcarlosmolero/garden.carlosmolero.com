# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Carlos


I'm delighted that you've stopped by my digital garden.

Remember that <b>I am open to working as a software engineer or UX/UI designer on a freelance basis</b>. Click <a class="internal-link" href="/hire-me">here</a> to learn about my professional background and how to hire me.
</div>

I was born and raised in **Malaga, Spain** ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸, and **my first love was psychology**. 

Unfortunately, I was not able to dedicate myself to it because it is a field with few job opportunities.

Later on, I decided to get a **degree in Computer Science** and learn **UX/UI design** in a self-taught way.

I consider myself an **extremely fortunate person to be able to dedicate myself to these two professions** that bring me so much happiness by allowing me to create products and tools that improve and brighten the lives of thousands of people.

Likewise, it is also a joy to be able to use them in the hobbies and activities that I am passionate about, like building this site.

> I would love for people to celebrate at my funeral how much I helped them and made them enjoy themselves.
