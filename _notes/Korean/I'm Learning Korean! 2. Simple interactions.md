### Greetings

1. 안녕하세요 (annyeonghaseyo) - which will be answered with the same formula. It's like saying **How are you?**
2. 안녕히가세요 (annyeonghikaseyo) - which will be answered with the latter. In this case, adding 가 changes the meaning to **all the best**. It's said when someone leaves.
3. 안녕히계세요 (annyeonghikaeseyo) - In this case, adding 계 changes the meaning to **stay well**. It's said when you leave.

2. 아니에요 (annieyo) - widely used today. Means, literally, **it's not**.
3. 게 (ne) - also widely used today. Means **yes**.
