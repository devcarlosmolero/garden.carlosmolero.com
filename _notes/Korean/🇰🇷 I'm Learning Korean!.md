If you know me, you will know that my partner is from South Korea and that I have decided to learn Korean because I am convinced that **to know a person you have to know their culture deeply and there is no greater expression of a people's culture than their language**.

Throughout my life I have learned some languages such as English or French but **this is different for me and an absolute departure from my comfort zone**... 

But hey, the one who fails for sure is the one who doesn't try, let's get to it!
