As you may know, If you *really* know me, my partner is from South Korea. 

Since I am convinced that **to know a person you have to know their culture deeply and there is no greater expression of a people's culture than their language**, I have decided to learn Korean for her.

Throughout my life I have learned some languages such as English or French but **this is different for me and an absolute departure from my comfort zone**... 

But hey, the one who fails for sure is the one who doesn't try, let's get to it!
