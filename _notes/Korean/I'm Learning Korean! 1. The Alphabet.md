There are 10 vowels and 11 basic consonants.

### Basic vowels

| Vowel | Sound |
| ----- | ----- |
| ㅏ    | a     |
| ㅑ    | ia    |
| ㅓ    | e     |
| ㅕ    | ie    |
| ㅗ    | o     |
| ㅛ    | io    |
| ㅜ    | u     |
| ㅠ    | iu    |
| ㅡ    | w     |
| ㅣ    | i     |

Depending on the position of the lines around the \| (person symbol) we will always expect the following sounds:

| Position | Sound |
| -------- | ----- |
| Left     | e     |
| Right    | a     |
| Top      | o     |
| Buttom   | u     |

<div class="notice">
<b>Rule of thumb: </b> The ground (\_) always goes under the consonants and the person always around them (\|, e.g., 아)
</div>

### Compound vowels

This doesn't make much sense, unlike the simple vowels, so I guess I'll just memorize it and that's it.

| Vowel        | Sound          |
| ------------ | -------------- |
| ㅐ (ㅏ + ㅣ) | e (a + i)      |
| ㅒ (ㅑ + ㅣ) | ie (ia + i)    |
| ㅔ (ㅓ + ㅣ) | e (e + i)      |
| ㅖ (ㅕ + ㅣ) | e (ie + i)     |
| ㅘ (ㅗ + ㅏ) | wa (o + a)     |
| ㅙ (ㅗ + ㅐ) | we (o + e)     |
| ㅚ (ㅗ + ㅣ) | we (exception) |
| ㅞ (ㅜ + ㅔ) | we (u + e)     |
| ㅟ (ㅜ + ㅣ) | wi (u + i)     |
| ㅝ (ㅜ + ㅓ) | wo (u + e)     |
| ㅢ (ㅡ + ㅣ) | wi (exception) |

### Basic consonants

| Consonant | Sound                   |
| --------- | ----------------------- |
| ㄱ        | g                       |
| ㄴ        | n                       |
| ㄷ        | d                       |
| ㄹ        | l, r                    |
| ㅁ        | m                       |
| ㅂ        | b                       |
| ㅅ        | s, sh (if used with \|) |
| ㅇ        | - (silent)              |
| ㅈ        | j (English)             |
| ㅊ        | ch                      |
| ㅋ        | k (releasing air)       |
| ㅌ        | t (releasing air)       |
| ㅍ        | p (releasing air)       |


<div class="notice">
<b>Rule of thumb: </b> There must ALWAYS be a consonant and a vowel. In Spanish or English there is no problem in putting an “a” alone, the “a” sound is emitted, period. However, in Korean for a vowel to make a sound, at least the silent consonant ㅇ (in this case 아) must be used.
</div>

### Compound consonants

| Consonant | Sound        |
| --------- | ------------ |
| ㄲ        | explosive c  |
| ㄸ        | explosive t  |
| ㅃ        | explosive p  |
| ㅆ        | explosive ss |
| ㅉ        | explosive jj |

### Batchim rules

When there is a consonant below, instead of a horizontal vowel (ㅡ), that is said to be the consonant Batchim (meaning “bracket” in English). Depending on which consonant is the Batchim, the pronunciation of the word may change.

| Batchim consonant | Sound                                                                                                            |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ㅅ                | becomes a 'T'                                                                                                    |
| ㄹ                | always pronounced as 'L', without exceptions                                                                     |
| ㅇ                | will be pronounced as 'NG', but if this Batchim happens at the end of the word it will be pronounced as just "N" |
