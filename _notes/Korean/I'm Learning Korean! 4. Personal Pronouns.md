title: I'm Learning Korean! 4. Personal Pronouns
---
Korean does not distinguish between genders (except for the third person), as is the case in Spanish.

Similarly, as with other words in this language, there are informal and formal ways of using pronouns.

Knowing this:

| Person     | Level           | Singular      | Plural              | Meaning          |
| ---------- | --------------- | ------------- | ------------------- | ---------------- |
| **First**  | Common          | 나 (na)        | 우리 (uri)            | Me / Us          |
|            | Formal          | 저 (jeo)       | 저희 (jeohui)         | Me / Us          |
| **Second** | Common          | 너 (neo)       | 너희 (neohui)         | You / You        |
|            | Formal          | 당신 (dangsin)  | 당신들 (dangsin-deul)  | You / You        |
| **Third**  | Common (male)   | 그 (geu)       | 그들 (geu-deul)       | He / Them        |
|            | Common (female) | 그녀 (geu-nyeo) | 그녀들 (geu-nyeo-deul) | She / Them       |
|            | Formal          | 이분 (i-bun)    | 이분들 (i-bun-deul)    | He or She / Them |

We can notice that there is a pattern in some words, and that is that 들 is added at the end. **This is literally the plural, like the 'S' in Spanish**.

Likewise, if we find 씨 after a word we can infer that the word is a person's name, **씨 means Mr or Miss.**
