title: I'm Learning Korean! 3. Verbs
---
In Korean, verbs are not conjugated depending on the subject only on the tense.

> That is, there would be no difference between saying “I'm” and “You're”. In Korean, the conjugation of this verb would not change because the subject does.

This simplifies things, but it can also be confusing because we have to be aware of the context. **Korean is a very contextual language**.

Another thing to keep in mind is that **verbs always come at the end and always end sentences in Korean**.
