title: I'm Learning Korean! 3. Verbs
---
In Korean, verbs are not conjugated depending on the subject only on the tense.

That is, there would be no difference between saying “I'm” and “You're”. In Korean, the conjugation of this verb would not change because the subject does.

This simplifies things, but it can also be confusing because we have to be aware of the context. **Korean is a very contextual language**.

Another thing to keep in mind is that **verbs always come at the end and always end sentences in Korean**.
### Special use case: To Be And Not To Be

The verb 'to be' has a different form depending on whether the word before them has 받침 or not.

| **Verb**      | **Condition** | **Append**         |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------------ |
| **To Be**     | With 받침       | 이에요 (ieyo)         |
|               | Without 받침    | 예요 (yeyo)          |
| **Not To Be** | With 받침       | 이아니에요 (i-annieyo)  |
|               | Without 받침    | 가아니에요 (ga-annieyo) |

Finally, it is important to remember that verbs always come last in the sentence.

<b>Fun fact:</b> Speaking of which, my girlfriend has told me that this is why Koreans don't interrupt each other so much when speaking (as do Spaniards, and presumably other Europeans). It is more difficult for them to cut off their interlocutor because the verb, which is especially important, comes at the end and is what gives meaning to the whole sentence so they can't predict the meaning until it is finished.
