title: Let's build a Text Adventure Engine in Ruby
---
To remind myself again how to create software with this wonderful language, I've set out to start this simple but challenging project.

Like any good developer, before putting your fingers on the keyboard, the first thing to do is to think.

And the first thing I have to think about is:

What basic components does a technical user (developer) need to build a Text Adventure game?

- A component that analyzes the user input.
- A component that allows me to manage the story and its bifurcations.

Below you have the notes in which I document the creation of these components:

- [[Ruby Text Adventure Engine, Commander]]
- [[Ruby Text Adventure Engine, Level Manager]]
