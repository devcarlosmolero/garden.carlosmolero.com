title: Let's build a Text Adventure Engine in Ruby
---
To remind myself again how to create software with this wonderful language, I've set out to start a simple but challenging project.

In this compilation, I want to document, step by step, the process of creating a series of gems (libraries) to facilitate the process of creating a Text Adventure game with Ruby.

Like any good developer, before putting your fingers on the keyboard, the first thing to do is to think.

And the first thing I have to think about is:

What basic components does a technical user (developer) need to build a Text Adventure game?

- A component that analyzes the user input.
- A component that allows me to manage the story and its bifurcations.
- A component that is the graphical part.

Below you have the notes in which I document the creation of these components:

- [[Ruby Text Adventure Engine, Commander]]
- [[Ruby Text Adventure Engine, Level Manager]]
