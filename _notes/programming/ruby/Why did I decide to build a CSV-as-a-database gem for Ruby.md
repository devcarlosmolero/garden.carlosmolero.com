title: Why did I decide to build a CSV-as-a-database gem for Ruby?
---
First, because I want to.

Second, because I think there are many implementations of JSON-as-a-database but the format of the CSV files lends itself much more to function as a database.

In fact, you can use CSV viewers in Visual Studio Code just as you would use a database viewer like DBeaver, which comes in handy for debugging and seeing what's going on.
